# Overview

This documentation intends to explain how to get Penpot application and run it locally, test it, or make changes to it.

There are two main options for creating a local on-premise instance:

1. Using the platform of our partner <a href="https://elest.io/" target="_blank">Elestio</a>.
2. Doing the installation yourself with Docker.

<p class="advice">
If you don't have experience using Docker or if you want a fully automatically managed service, we recommend using Elestio. Otherwise, go for Docker.
</p>

* In the [Install with Elestio][1] section, you can find details on how to open an Elestio account and create your Penpot instance.

* In the [Install with Docker][2] section, you can find the official Docker installation guide.

* In the [Configuration][3] section, you can find more advanced setup options.

* If you are a developer and want to get into the code, we recommend the [Developer Guide][4] that explains how to properly setup a development environment and many other dev-oriented documentation.
